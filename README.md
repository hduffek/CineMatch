# Release Notes (7/14/2023)
Project currently supports login functionality and user email confirmation. A questionnaire has been added but not integrated, the user profile also has yet to be expanded. This is in large part due to the integration of the database TMDB. We're confident we can integrate the data we need, but the setup has proven more daunting than anticipated. These will be our main focuses moving into the next milestone; user profile expansion, database utilization, visible end-result for user choices.
